 <p class="highlight-left quote">"If there is no struggle, there is no progress"</p>

I always loved to dabble in code, i wanted to get back to coding from my design and consulting job, thus i decided to call it quits on my 4+ year as a Network Consultant at Cisco. Feeling quiet comfortable and accomplished in my current role, It was a big decision to quit and start from scratch to get into development.

I made a conscious decision, if i am not going to pursue something i love to do, it wouldn't make any sense to build a career in something i may not enjoy, with a single thought in my mind, when i turn 50 and reflect back in life, would i be happy with what i have done and achieved.

Once i made the decision, it was not too bad, things flew by i wrapped up work, bid adieu to friends and colleagues and slept in late on my first day of being unemployed. :)

it was extremely difficult the first week, i would constantly check my phone for new emails and calls, days seemed longer with nothing to do, but it was liberating after a while.

I picked up my books and started to read them, took a 2 month long vacation with family in Oman, meanwhile i wanted to keep in touch with study too, first things i did was do an introduction to [Computer Science by Harvard, CS-50](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science), i would recommend this course for beginner's and people who have lost touch with programming in general. The course is excellent and the staff and mentors are exemplary.

Post the course, it was a hard decision again, which stream of coding and development to pursue, i tried my hands with iOS app development, web development & systems design, (already having some experience with web development & systems design).

Having built large networks, things the Internet runs on, i wanted to move up the stack and build applications for users, play with design and explore my creative side, when this realization hit, it made sense to start honing my skills in full stack development, thus i began my long journey to learn, unlearn and relearn WebDev technologies.

Having completed a satisfactory but yet in a learning phase mode, i am out now to look for a job as a web developer, will keep the blog updated on how it goes. ;)
